# NumberValidation
This repository consists of the solution of the programming test

Below are some features implemented in he program:
1. TDD approach has been implemented. Two scenarios, one for negetive and other for zero has been imbibed in the code and its respective    excpetion has been handled.

2. An Inteface 'ValidateInput' has been created where the funtion to print the reqiured pattern has been declared. The interface has been    implemented in class 'ValidateInputImpl'.

3. A Hashmap has been created where value are being stored as a key-value pair of integer and string. 

4. Values correspding to the given condition in the problem statement are stored in the correspoding keys.

5. Custom exception has been implemented to handle exceptions for i) Negetive number ii) Zero input iii) Floating point numbers
